# Styling

> React does not have an opinion about how styles are defined; if in doubt, a
> good starting point is to define your styles in a separate `*.css` file as
> usual and refer to them using `className`.

## Global CSS

![the ol' reliable]

- just import some CSS
- no scoping
- have to use [BEM]

```yaml {example}
project: styling-global
```

## CSS modules

- just import some CSS
- must be named `*.module.css`
- classes automatically scoped, worry free naming
- CSS bundled with component
- short class names in production
- less dead CSS

```yaml {example}
project: styling-module
```

- note that both CSS approaches have to use the [`style`] prop for dynamic styles

[`style`]: https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style

## CSS in JS

- common pattern in React apps **provided by libraries**
- [`styled-components`][styled] most popular

  > - Automatic critical CSS
  > - No class name bugs
  > - Easier deletion of CSS
  > - Simple dynamic styling
  > - Painless maintenance
  > - Automatic vendor prefixing

- fantastic for dynamic styling
- component fully contained in single file
- needs [extension] for syntax highlighting

```yaml {example}
project: styling-styled
```

## PS

- it doesn't matter which approach you use, but don't mix them
