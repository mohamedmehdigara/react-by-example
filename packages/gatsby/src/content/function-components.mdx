# Function Components

## Stateless Components

- pure function that takes children and props and outputs JSX
- pure means no side-effects
- children are the elements in the component's subtree
- props are attributes
- type: `React.FunctionComponent`, `FC` for short

```yaml {example}
project: stateless-component
```

## Stateful Components

- a function component that uses [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
- can have state and side-effects

```yaml {example}
project: stateful-component
```
