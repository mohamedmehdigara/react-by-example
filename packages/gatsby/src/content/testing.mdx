```yaml {example}
type: test
project: testing-dummy
module: src/index.test.ts
```

### `GifFinder`

- let's test a component that uses state & effects to find gifs

```yaml {example}
project: testing-components
style:
  width: 100%
  height: 50em
```

### Testing `GifFinder`

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,
> the more confidence they can give you.

- [`create-react-app`] comes with [`@testing-library`]
- works with [angular], [vue], [plain DOM][dom], etc...
- no selectors, [forcing] you to write accessible components
- alternatively, use [enzyme]
