## Custom Hooks

- shorthand for a series of built-in hook calls
- follow the [rules]
- **ALWAYS** test by implementing in a component
- when using effects **ALWAYS** test unmounting
- when returning functions **ALWAYS** use [`useCallback`]

[rules]: /hooks#rules
[`usecallback`]: /advanced-hooks#usecallback

### Build-Your-Own Formik

- still use [formik], this just shows that it's not _✨magic✨_
- cf. [basic formik]

[formik]: https://formik.org/
[basic formik]: https://formik.org/docs/examples/basic

```yaml {example}
project: custom-hooks-formik
```
