## Events & Forms

### Events

- handlers are props
- `tsx∫onSomeEvent={event => console.log(event.target)}`
- events are ["synthetic"], normalized between browsers
- [supported events]

["synthetic"]: https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html
[supported events]: https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events

```yaml {example}
project: forms-event-log
```

> - note that `pushEvent` is not simply `ts∫eventLog.push(event)`
> - this is because React needs to know about the update, thru `setEventLog`
> - and React needs the updated value to be a new array, to avoid a [bailout], thru [spread]

[bailout]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update
[spread]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_array_literals

### Forms

- use `value` & `onChange` props to control form items

```yaml {example}
project: forms-simple-input
```

- with multiple form items

```yaml {example}
project: forms-simple-form
```

- using plain React to handle complex forms doesn't scale well
- use [formik] ([recommended by React][recommendation]), or other form library

[formik]: https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/
[recommendation]: https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#fully-fledged-solutions

```yaml {example}
project: forms-formik
```
