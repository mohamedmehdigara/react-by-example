# Events & Forms

## Events

- handlers are props
- `tsxâˆ«onSomeEvent={event => console.log(event.target)}`
- events are ["synthetic"](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html), normalized between browsers
- [supported events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events)

[formik]: https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/
[recommendation]: https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#fully-fledged-solutions

```yaml {example}
project: forms-event-log
```

## Forms

- use `value` & `onChange` props to control form items

```yaml {example}
project: forms-simple-input
```

- with multiple form items

```yaml {example}
project: forms-simple-form
```

- using plain React to handle complex forms doesn't scale well
- use [formik] ([recommended by React][recommendation]), or other form library

```yaml {example}
project: forms-formik
```
