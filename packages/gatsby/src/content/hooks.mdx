# Hooks

- allows state and side-effects in function components
- simple to use, but follow the [rules](#rules)
- create custom hooks, great for encapsulating common functionality

## Rules

- only call hooks at the top level
  - don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
  - rationale:
    - same hook can be used multiple times
    - they must be called in the same order _every time_, otherwise React does not know which hook is which
- only call hooks from React functions
  - don't call hooks from regular JavaScript functions
  - rationale:
    - hook state is bound to the _component instance_ that is being rendered
- (convention) custom hooks start with `use`

* [more details](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
* rules are enforceable [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)

## `useState`

- `ts∫const [currentState, setNextStateFn] = useState(initialValue?)`
- use for internal state that affects DOM
- takes initial value; returns a tuple of the current value and a function to update it
- [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)

```yaml {example}
project: hooks-use-state
```

## `useRef`

- `ts∫const ref = useRef(initialValue)`
- use to reference elements, eg. to use their methods
- [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)

```yaml {example}
project: hooks-use-ref
```

- use for internal state that _does not_ affect DOM, eg. timer handles

```yaml {example}
project: hooks-use-ref-alt
```

## `useEffect`

- `ts∫useEffect(effectFn, deps?)`
- use for side-effects
- `effectFn`: function that can have side-effects; optionally return cleanup function
- `deps`: a list of values that the side-effect depends on (optional)
- when dependencies change, the effect is cleaned up and ran again
- if no dependencies are given, then the effect runs on every render
- [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)

```yaml {example}
project: hooks-use-effect
```
