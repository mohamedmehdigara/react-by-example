## Higher Order Components

### Higher Order Functions

> A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
>
> - takes one or more functions as arguments
> - returns a function as its result
>
> -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)

### What?

> A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
>
> -- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)

- `tsâˆ«const ComponentWithFeature = withFeature(InternalComponent)`
- usually for injecting props in the wrapped component

### Why?

- [code sharing] for class components (and `FC`s)
- `FC`s should always use [hooks]
- HOCs can be [composed]

[code sharing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern
[hooks]: /custom-hooks
[composed]: https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#convention-maximizing-composability

### `withTheme`

- `withTheme` is a HOC that encapsulates `ThemeContext`
- note the [`displayName` convention]

[`displayname` convention]: https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#convention-wrap-the-display-name-for-easy-debugging

```yaml {example}
project: hoc-theme
module: src/theme-library/with-theme.tsx
render: false
```

- injected `theme` prop can be used outside of render (cf. [`Context.Consumer`])

[`context.consumer`]: https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextconsumer

```yaml {example}
project: hoc-theme
```
